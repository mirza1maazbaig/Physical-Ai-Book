# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, teaching you how to apply AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## About This Book

This educational resource is designed for university-level students and practitioners with foundational AI knowledge. Through project-driven learning, you will explore:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How AI systems operate in the physical world
- **Robot Middleware**: Mastering ROS 2 for robot communication and control
- **Simulation & Digital Twins**: Using Gazebo for realistic humanoid robot simulation
- **Navigation Systems**: Implementing Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Integrating voice, vision, and action systems

## Getting Started

This book is structured into four main modules, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding robot middleware fundamentals
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo)** - Simulation and digital twin technologies
3. **Module 3: Navigation for Humanoids (Nav2)** - Path planning for bipedal systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrating perception and cognition

Each module contains practical exercises, code examples, and capstone projects that demonstrate real-world applications of the concepts covered.
